# Stack Overflow in Recursive Function

This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive function.  The function `foo()` calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. When a large number is passed as an argument, the recursive calls exceed the maximum recursion depth, leading to a stack overflow.

The solution provides an iterative approach to calculate the factorial, avoiding the stack overflow issue.  This example highlights the importance of considering recursion depth limits when working with recursive functions, especially for large inputs.
